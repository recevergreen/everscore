"""
Virtual Scoreboard Client
--------------------------

Connects to a physical Daktronics-compatible scoreboard over USB-serial (Prolific PL2303)
and prints real-time updates to stdout.

Usage:
  1. Plug your PL2303-based cable into macOS, install/approve the driver.
  2. Run this script. It will auto-detect the serial port (if possible),
	 or fall back to the default path.
  3. Watch the console for scoreboard updates!
